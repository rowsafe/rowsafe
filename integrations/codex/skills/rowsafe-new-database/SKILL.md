description: Use when the app you are building needs a PostgreSQL database and there is none yet (no DATABASE_URL, or the user asks for one) - a new Rowsafe Cloud server, or a new database and login on a Rowsafe Cloud server the organization already has. Picks the cheapest fitting size, tells the user the price and gets their OK, creates it with the user's rights, waits until it is ready, and puts the connection string in the app's environment without anyone else seeing the password.

# Need a database? (Rowsafe Cloud)

Rowsafe Cloud is PostgreSQL that Rowsafe runs and protects from the first minute (continuous backups, a weekly restore test, monitoring), billed to the user's organization. You can create one. You act as the person who connected you, right away, with exactly their rights in the Rowsafe dashboard. If Rowsafe refuses (the user is a member, a first payment is due and they aren't an owner, or it would go over the agents' budget), nothing is created or billed: tell the user the reason it gives and what they can do.

The tools come from Rowsafe's MCP server (`codex mcp login rowsafe` signs in). Making changes (`create_cloud_server`, `cloud_firewall`, `create_app_database`, `request_change`) needs the user to have allowed Codex to act at sign-in; if those tools aren't listed, ask the user to create the server in the Rowsafe dashboard (Create a server) and to give you the connection string.

## Steps

1. **Use what exists.** Call `list_cloud_servers`: if the organization already has a ready server the app can use, skip to step 5 with its database.
2. **Pick a size.** Call `cloud_catalog`. Choose a region near where the app runs and the cheapest size that fits; a new or small app fits the smallest size (it names the cheapest one free now, about $10 a month at most). Don't pick a size that is sold out in that region. Tell the user what you picked and what it costs, per hour and at most per month, and wait for their OK.
3. **Create it.** Once the user agrees, call `create_cloud_server` (or `request_change` with action `create_cloud_server`, no database) with `name` (like `shop-db`), `region`, `size`, and `allowed_ips` (the addresses the app connects from; leave it empty if you don't know them yet). The reason says what it's for, in one or two plain sentences. Then, depending on the result:
   - **Done**: the server is being created. Tell the user what you created and what it costs.
   - **A checkout link**: the organization has no pay as you go yet (or its cloud is billed by the month). The server waits for payment; give the user the link to pay (only an owner can). It is created once paid.
   - **Refused**: nothing was created. Tell the user the reason and what they can do, and stop.
4. **Wait.** The result shows the server's ID. Call `get_cloud_server` with it and `wait_seconds` until it is `ready` (5 to 10 minutes; it may first wait for payment).
5. **Let the app in.** `get_cloud_server` shows who can connect. If the app's address isn't listed, call `cloud_firewall` with the server and the whole new `allowed_ips` list.
6. **Get the app its own database and login.** Rowsafe never makes or sees the password.
   - Through a local `rowsafe mcp` (the CLI) on PostgreSQL: call `create_app_database` with the server's database (as `get_cloud_server` shows it), a `name` for the app's database, and a reason. The password is made on this machine and Rowsafe only gets its verifier: you get the full connection string at once, shown only once. It works once `get_task` shows the task succeeded.
   - Connected with Sign in with Rowsafe (this plugin's server), or on MySQL, MariaDB or ClickHouse: the password must be made in the user's browser, so ask the user to create the database in the Rowsafe dashboard (Databases & users), which shows them the connection string once. Ask them to paste it into the app's `.env` themselves, or to give it to you.
7. **Store it safely.** Put the connection string in the app's environment, e.g. `DATABASE_URL` in `.env`, and make sure `.env` is in `.gitignore`. Never put it in code, a commit or a log, and don't repeat it back in the chat. Keep `sslmode=require` as given.

## Later

- A bigger size: `request_change` `resize_cloud_server` (the database is offline a few minutes; Rowsafe saves a Mark first). Tell the user the new price and the downtime first, and wait for their OK.
- A copy to test on: `request_change` `clone_to_new_server` with `delete_after_hours` (tell the user what it costs first), or a masked `create_safe_copy` on the same server.
- Deleting a server is `request_change` `delete_cloud_server`: only when the user asks, and only after you confirm with them which server it is: the server and anything not backed up are gone, and its bill stops. Rowsafe types the server's name for you and records that it did; its backups stay in Rowsafe Storage. With no backup yet (or no saved backup passphrase), Rowsafe refuses: tell the user why.
- Before migrations and other risky changes, follow the `rowsafe-safety` skill.
